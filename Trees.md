[Back to Overview](https://github.com/lachisholm/Data_Structure_Discovery/blob/main/Overview.md)

Trees are hierarchical data structures composed of nodes connected by edges. Each
node can have zero or more child nodes, forming a branching structure. Trees are
widely used for representing hierarchical relationships, such as file systems,
organization charts, or hierarchical data in databases. They also play a crucial role in
algorithms and data structures, with various types of trees like binary trees, binary
search trees, AVL trees, and B-trees optimized for different purposes. Trees offer
efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations, making them essential in many
applications requiring organized and structured data.
