### Data Structures.

Understanding data structures and their underlying concepts is important in computer science because they form the foundation upon which efficient algorithms are built and aptimized. My own personal journey in learning data structures has consistently underscored the significance of selecting the appropriate data structure for a given problem. This choice directly influences the commplexity, efficiency, and scalability of the solution. Data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs each offer unique advantages and are suited to specific types of problems and computational tasks. Mastery of these structures not only enables the development of more effective algorithms but also fosters a deeper comprehension of how information can be organized, accessed, and manipulated to meet the demands of both simple and complex systems. A solid grasp of data structures is indispensable for any computer scientist or software developer aspiring to solve real world problems efficiently and innovate within the field.

As part of this discussion I will cover the fundamental data structures. These structures are concepts that are the basics of data structures in the computer science field. I found that many of these structures are easy to learn with reading the right sources and information that is found over the internet and throughout Data Science books.Here is a list of the concepts that I will cover in this reading and tutorial.

[Trees](https://github.com/lachisholm/Data_Structure_Discovery/blob/main/Trees.md)

[LIFO - Last In, First Out](https://github.com/lachisholm/Data_Structure_Discovery/blob/main/LIFO.md)

All four concepts’ maps, linked lists, stacks(LIFO), and trees all aim to efficiently organize
and manage data, each tailored to specific needs.

➢ They offer different trade-offs in terms of performance, memory usage, and operations.

➢ Linked lists can be used to implement certain types of trees, particularly binary trees, where
each node contains references to its left and right children.

➢ Maps (dictionaries) and trees can be interconnected, as trees can be used to implement
map-like structures, such as binary search trees, where keys are sorted for efficient
retrieval.

➢ LIFO, central to stack operations, complements trees and linked lists in depth first searches
and enables efficient backtracking, whereas in maps it can track the most recent additions
for operations like undo.

➢ Understanding these four data structures provides a solid foundation for designing and
implementing more complex data structures and algorithms in software development.

These data structures are essential for organizing and managing data efficiently in various algorithms and applications that I will build throughout a career and they are so fundamental that they are essential to learn.
