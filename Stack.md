# Practical Applications of Stack

### **LIFO: Last In, First Out**

The terms LIFO and FIFO refer to two distinct methods of managing data structures, particularly in the context of how data is stored, accessed, and removed. These methods are fundamental to computer science and software development, especially in algorithm design and system resource management.

LIFO stands for "Last In, First Out." It is a method where the last element added to a structure is the first one to be removed. This principle is akin to a stack of plates; you can only remove the top plate without disturbing the others, meaning the last plate placed on the stack is the first one taken off.

### **Characteristics of LIFO**

- **Addition (Push):** New elements are added to the top of the stack.
- **Removal (Pop):** Elements are removed from the top of the stack.
- **Top Element:** It's easy to see or access the top element, which is the last added item.
- **Use Cases:** LIFO is particularly useful in scenarios like function call management in programming languages (e.g., call stack), undo mechanisms in software, and parsing certain kinds of expressions.

### **FIFO: First In, First Out**

FIFO is an acronym for "First In, First Out." It is a method where the first element added to a structure is the first one to be removed. This is analogous to a line of people at a grocery store or movie theater; the first person to get in line is the first one to be served and leave.

### **Characteristics of FIFO**

- **Addition (Enqueue):** New elements are added to the end of the queue.
- **Removal (Dequeue):** Elements are removed from the beginning of the queue.
- **Front and Rear Elements:** In a FIFO structure, you can easily access the first (front of the line) and the last (rear of the line) elements, representing the first added and last added items, respectively.
- **Use Cases:** FIFO is widely used in resource scheduling, such as printer queues, buffering data streams, and handling asynchronous data transfers between software components.

The LIFO (Last In, First Out) and FIFO (First In, First Out) concepts typically apply to queues and stacks, but they do not directly apply to maps, linked lists, and trees. However, both LIFO and FIFO can be associated with these data structures in the context of specific applications or operations.

### **Maps (or Associative Arrays)**

Maps, collections of key-value pairs, do not inherently adhere to LIFO or FIFO principles as they are designed for fast retrieval, insertion, and deletion based on keys. Nevertheless, for specific applications, stacks (LIFO) or queues (FIFO) can be utilized to track the insertion order in maps. This approach is beneficial in scenarios such as implementing undo functionality (using LIFO) where the most recently added entry needs to be removed first, or ensuring processing order (using FIFO) for operations that must occur in the sequence they were initiated.

### **Linked Lists**

Linked lists themselves are not inherently LIFO or FIFO structures. However, by adding and removing elements from the same end, a linked list can implement a stack (LIFO), effectively utilizing the LIFO principle. Conversely, by adding elements at one end and removing them from the other, a linked list can function as a queue (FIFO), embodying the FIFO principle. This flexibility allows linked lists to support a variety of applications requiring specific orderings of data processing.

### **Trees**

Trees do not intrinsically operate on LIFO or FIFO principles. However, tree traversal algorithms, such as Depth-First Search (DFS), can utilize a stack (LIFO) to explore the depth of the tree first, moving through one branch to its leaves before backtracking to explore other branches. Alternatively, Breadth-First Search (BFS) utilizes a queue (FIFO) to explore the breadth of the tree, examining all nodes at a particular depth before moving to the nodes at the next depth level. These approaches demonstrate how both LIFO and FIFO principles can be applied in specific tree operations.

### **LIFO (Stack)**

Optimized for scenarios where the most recent data is of the highest priority. LIFO is used in applications where the order of operations must be reversed, or the last performed operation needs to be accessed quickly.

### **FIFO (Queue)**

FIFO is optimized for scenarios requiring processing in the order that data or tasks were received. It is particularly useful in resource scheduling, managing tasks in operating systems, or handling asynchronous data transfers between software components.

LIFO(stack)

- Push(Addition) Adds an element to the top, the effieciency is O(1)
- Pop(Removal) Removes the top element. O(1)
- Peek (Access Next) Returns the top element without removing O(1)
- IsEmpty (Check Empty): Checks if the stack is empty. O(1)

![FIFO](FIFOblock.jpg "First in and First out") Cadre Technologies

FIFO(Queue) Best suited for scenarios where the order of operations or data processing must remain consistent over time. It is used in scheduling and sequential processing tasks where the first input should be the first to be processed or executed.
FIFO(Queue)

- Enqueue(Addition): Adds an element to the end. O(1)
- Dequeue(Removal) Removes the first element O(1)
- Front (Access Next): Returns the first element without removing O(1)
- IsEmpty(Check Empty) Checks if the queue is empty O(1)

Here is a LIFO (stack Implementation)

```Python
class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

    def push(self, item):

        """O(1) """
        self.items.append(item)

    def pop(self):
        """O(1)"""
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items.pop()
        return None

    def peek(self):
        """O(1)"""
        if not self.is_empty()
            return self.items[-1]
        return None

    def is_empty(self):
        """O(1) operation"""
        return len(self.items) == 0

# Example usage
stack = Stack()
stack.push(1)
stack.push(2)
print(stack.peek())
stack.pop()
print(stack.peek())
```

Here is FIFO implementation using a collections.deque in python

```Python
from collections import deque

class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = deque()

    def enqueue(self, item):
        """O(1)"""
        self.items.append(item)

    def dequeue(self):
        """O(1)"""
        if not self.is_empty()
        return self.items.popleft()
    return None

    def front(self):
        """O(1)"""
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items[0]
        return None

    def is_empty(self):
        """O(1)"""
        return len(self.items) == 0

queue = Queue()


```
