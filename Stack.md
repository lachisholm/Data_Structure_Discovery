# Practical Applications of Stack

### **LIFO: Last In, First Out**

The terms LIFO and FIFO refer to two distinct methods of managing data structures, particularly in the context of how data is stored, accessed, and removed. These methods are fundamental to computer science and software development, especially in algorithm design and system resource management.

LIFO stands for "Last In, First Out." It is a method where the last element added to a structure is the first one to be removed. This principle is akin to a stack of plates; you can only remove the top plate without disturbing the others, meaning the last plate placed on the stack is the first one taken off.

### **Characteristics of LIFO**

- **Addition (Push):** New elements are added to the top of the stack.
- **Removal (Pop):** Elements are removed from the top of the stack.
- **Top Element:** It's easy to see or access the top element, which is the last added item.
- **Use Cases:** LIFO is particularly useful in scenarios like function call management in programming languages (e.g., call stack), undo mechanisms in software, and parsing certain kinds of expressions.

### **FIFO: First In, First Out**

FIFO is an acronym for "First In, First Out." It is a method where the first element added to a structure is the first one to be removed. This is analogous to a line of people at a grocery store or movie theater; the first person to get in line is the first one to be served and leave.

### **Characteristics of FIFO**

- **Addition (Enqueue):** New elements are added to the end of the queue.
- **Removal (Dequeue):** Elements are removed from the beginning of the queue.
- **Front and Rear Elements:** In a FIFO structure, you can easily access the first (front of the line) and the last (rear of the line) elements, representing the first added and last added items, respectively.
- **Use Cases:** FIFO is widely used in resource scheduling, such as printer queues, buffering data streams, and handling asynchronous data transfers between software components.

The LIFO concept does not directly apply to maps, linked lists, and trees however LIFO can be
associated with these data structures in the context of specific applications or operations
Starting with maps or associative arrays, which are collections of key value pairs. They do not
inherently follow a LIFO principle as they are designed for fast retrieval, insertion, and deletion
based on keys. However, you can use stacks to track the insertion order in maps if needed for
specific applications, such as undo functionality in a key value store where the most recently
added entry needs to be removed first. Linked lists themselves are not LIFO structures, you can
implement a stack using a linked list by adding and removing elements from the same end of the
list, effectively utilizing the LIFO principle in the context of linked list operations. Trees do not
intrinsically operated on a LIFO principle, but tree traversal algorithms, such as depth first search
(DFS) can utilize a stack and the LIFO principle to explore the depth of the tree first, moving
through one branch to its leaves before backtracking to explore other branches.

LIFO(Stack) Optimized for scenarios where the most recent data is of the highest priority. It is used in applications where the order of operations must be reversed or last performed operation needs to be accessed quickly.

LIFO(stack)

- Push(Addition) Adds an element to the top, the effieciency is O(1)
- Pop(Removal) Removes the top element. O(1)
- Peek (Access Next) Returns the top element without removing O(1)
- IsEmpty (Check Empty): Checks if the stack is empty. O(1)

FIFO(Queue) Best suited for scenarios where the order of operations or data processing must remain consistent over time. It is used in scheduling and sequential processing tasks where the first input should be the first to be processed or executed.
FIFO(Queue)

- Enqueue(Addition): Adds an element to the end. O(1)
- Dequeue(Removal) Removes the first element O(1)
- Front (Access Next): Returns the first element without removing O(1)
- IsEmpty(Check Empty) Checks if the queue is empty O(1)

Here is a LIFO (stack Implementation)

```Python
class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

    def push(self, item):

        """O(1) """
        self.items.append(item)

    def pop(self):
        """O(1)"""
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items.pop()
        return None

    def peek(self):
        """O(1)"""
        if not self.is_empty()
            return self.items[-1]
        return None

    def is_empty(self):
        """O(1) operation"""
        return len(self.items) == 0

# Example usage
stack = Stack()
stack.push(1)
stack.push(2)
print(stack.peek())
stack.pop()
print(stack.peek())
```

Here is FIFO implementation using a collections.deque in python

```Python
from collections import deque

class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = deque()

    def enqueue(self, item):
        """O(1)"""
        self.items.append(item)

    def dequeue(self):
        """O(1)"""
        if not self.is_empty()
        return self.items.popleft()
    return None

    def front(self):
        """O(1)"""
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items[0]
        return None

    def is_empty(self):
        """O(1)"""
        return len(self.items) == 0

queue = Queue()




```

Understanding and appplying the appropriate data structure based on LIFO or FIFO principles is crucial in developing efficient algorithms and systems.
