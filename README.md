# Understanding Fundamental Data Structures

## I. Introduction

### A. Overview

As part of our class we cover the fundamental data structures. These structures are concepts that are the basics of data structures in the computer science field. I found that many of these structures are easy to learn with reading the right sources and information that is found over the internet and throughout Data Science books.Here is a list of the concepts that we will cover in this reading.

<ul>
    <li>-Map (also known as dictionaries)
    <li>-Linked lists
    <li>-Trees
    <li>-Last In, First Out (LIFO) concept
</ul>

These data structures are essential for organizing and managing data efficiently in various algorithms and applications that we will build throughout our careers.
