# Python Data Structure Discovery

Exploration of Maps, Linked Lists, Trees, and (LIFO) stacks
BYU Idaho Winter 2024

I have learned that data structure discovery encompasses a multifaceted area of computer science which has been a treasure trove of information and learning. This is an area in computer science that delves into identifying, categorizing, and optimizing the ways in which data can or is organized and accessed and tested. The core of this exploration lies the intent to enhance computational efficiency. My learning of data structures during this semester has been an adventure and sometimes a experience of frustration.
